   Overview:            
  The Movie Ticke Booking Project is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the movie ticket purchasing experience, 
  levaraging moder technologies for an engaging using intreface.
Why this project?
  This project aims to simplify the movie ticket booking proccess while providing robust management tools for administrators.

Here i am handling three person in this application: 
*Admin => Can add Movies and he need to give a approval of the theatre owner for adding shows.
*Owner => Can add a shows/ Theatres. and he acn saw the details of ticket bookings.
*Cutomer => Can book the ticket which they need.

Once You Rgeister the account you will change the mongoose data for handle the admin pannel isAdmin: true. if isAdmin is false they can handle both theatre owner and customer .
If your are not a admin once you login it will automatically goes to customer path, you need to click on the underlined name it will goes to owner path imean profile. 
There you can handle (Owner) role. Again you click on the AARA Movies yopu come  back to the custopmer pannel.
